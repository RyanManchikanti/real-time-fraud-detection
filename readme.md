# 🛡 Real-Time Reinsurance Fraud Detection Using Kafka, PySpark, and Kubernetes

This is a **production-grade real-time data engineering project** designed to detect suspicious reinsurance claims using a **fully automated, modular, and observable pipeline** — all without machine learning.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build a real-time streaming system that:
- Ingests synthetic insurance claims
- Processes them using PySpark on Azure Databricks
- Flags potentially fraudulent claims using rule-based logic
- Stores clean and enriched data in Delta Lake
- Visualizes alerts and system metrics through dashboards and monitoring

## 🧪 Dev Instructions

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/real-time-fraud-detection.git
   cd real-time-fraud-detection
   ```

2. Start Kubernetes:

   ```bash
   minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192 --driver=docker
   ```

3. Apply Kafka YAML:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s/kafka-cluster.yaml
   kubectl apply -f infrastructure/k8s/claims-topic.yaml
   ```

4. Simulate claim data and process it in real time 🚀

### ✅ Now Save This As `README.md` at the root of your project.

Would you like me to also generate a:
- `.gitignore` file for Python + Terraform + VSCode clutter?
- Or help write your first commit message for this?

Just say the word.
